#Problem_Statement
Making an Alumni tracking and Association system. A system to connect Esteemed alumni to their juniors or freshers to provide them mentorship. Provide Alumni group chatting systems to let alumni connect among themselves. The website keeps track of an alumni’s various jobs and careers. It helps to provide trusted job referrals to students. Also helps with fund-raising opportunities for various college communities. The Group chat feature provides interaction with alumni and also rekindles their sense of brotherhood. Information on various job referrals, seminars, hackathons, job fairs, and internship offers can also be provided.

Alumni association main objective is to help former students find job opportunities and improve their chances of landing a job offer with opportunities for expanding a graduate’s professional network. 
Career counselling, seminars, webinars, and networking events may provide helpful information about the job market.
Being able to connect with former classmates can be another benefit to belonging to an alumni association. Whether this leads to a career opportunity or is simply a chance to catch up with old friends and acquaintances, graduates will benefit from alumni directories and online social media groups that keep the lines of communication open well after the caps and gowns have been removed.
 Connecting fellow alumni is one way to find career and social opportunities, but reconnecting with past professors can offer a wealth of opportunities as well.
Graduates often want to stay connected to their alma mater and help future generations of alumni have the same opportunities and positive experiences they did. Alumni associations offer a number of ways to give back, including gifts, endowments, membership fees, and volunteer opportunities. Giving back to an alumni association is a great way to keep the legacy going and ensure that future generations of students have the opportunity to pursue quality higher education.
